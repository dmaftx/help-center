As of now, there are two ways to convert a token within the Serum ecosystem:

## DEX

The convert function within the [Bonfida GUI](https://bonfida.com/dex/#/) will **only appear once you have connected your wallet**.

## SWAP

Also accessible from the header of Bonfida, [Serum Swap](https://swap.bonfida.com) has numerous listings available (including BTC, ETH, SOL, SRM, YFI, LINK, UNI ...) for you to try
