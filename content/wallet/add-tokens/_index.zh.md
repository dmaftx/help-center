When you start with the standard Bonfida wallet, you only have a SOL address by default. This is similar to how MetaMask only comes with the Ethereum section. To add tokens, head to the wallet page, click Add Token, and you will be offered a list of more than 20 popular tokens. If you see what you are looking for, click on Add.

Before adding the token you should expand it to check its Mint Address.

## ERC20

You can also add ERC20 tokens to your Bonfida wallet, which will then create the Solana-version of that token address (it will be a wrapped token).

## Manual Input

To add tokens that arenâ€™t in the default list, you can head to the **Manual Input** tab and do so in the same way as MetaMask.
