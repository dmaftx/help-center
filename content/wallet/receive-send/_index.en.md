Now that you have your first Bonfida wallet (and some free \$SOL), you can deposit some assets onto the Solana blockchain to interact with Serum the Bonfida way.

## Receiving & Sending (Wallet)

Depositing your assets into your Bonfida wallet is easy. Take SOL for example - just use your given deposit address and transact as you would with any other blockchain. If you want to deposit ETH to get more SOL, you can connect MetaMask to the Bonfida wallet to directly convert native ETH to SOL. This conversion will require network fees to pay both the Ethereum and Solana blockchain.

Sending tokens is a similar process and works as it does for any other wallet/blockchain youâ€™ve experienced. Just be sure to double-check your addresses as always. You can also convert SOL to native ETH through a MetaMask connection.

## Receiving & Sending (DEX)

To smoothen out the user experience of trading on Bonfida, you can directly withdraw your funds from the Wallet Balances page with Bonfida.
