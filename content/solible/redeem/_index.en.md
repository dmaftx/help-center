To redeem an item, you will have to access the auction page. Here, we will use the Serum Ledger Nano X as an example.

When you have connected a wallet that holds the NFT, the **Redeem** button will be enabled. Proceed to click on it and fill in your delivery information in the pop-up.

Lastly, you will have to approve the transaction after submitting your details - once this transaction is approved it will mean that the NFT has been redeemed! Once confirmed Bonfida will ship out the item and send out a confirmation email within 24 Hours for your NFT redemption.
