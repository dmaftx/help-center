Having your NFT creation listed on [Solible](https://solible.com/#/) is possible and easily done.

## Mint your token

A cool feature available on Solana through Bonfida, is to be able to mint your own token and decide on its characteristics.

Accessible from the [Bonfida](https://bonfida.com/) header Token -> Mint, or [https://bonfida.com/mint](https://bonfida.com/mint) ; you just need to type in your SOL address, the total supply and the decimals.
