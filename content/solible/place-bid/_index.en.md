To place a bid on a NFT, you will need to be connected to your SPL wallet. Once connected, you just need to type in the price as well as the size you want to bid for.

After submitting your order, you will need to approve the transaction on the tab, and as soon as you confirm it, you will see your order in the open order list and orderbook.

If the auctioned item is set with a predefined market price (i.e. the [Serum Ledger Nano X](https://solible.com/#/trade/327ubUZkUUAEdeWvyQYh1Ycs9mt6yDnt7jDAW47U3krw) at 50 \$SRM), bidding this price will result in an automatic purchase.

You will need to settle the NFT from your balances for it to be in your wallet. See the token [settlement article](/orders/settle)

_Bidding under the market price or submitting an offer to a countdown auction would be considered as an open order. When countdown reaches 0, the highest bid will automatically receive the token; while unsuccessful bids will remain as open orders in the orderbook._
