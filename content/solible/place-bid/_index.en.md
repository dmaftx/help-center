To place bids on an NFT, you will have to connect a Solana-based wallet such as [Sollet](https://sollet.io) to Solible - this is done at the top right corner of the site. As Solibe is powered by the same orderbook systema as Serum - you simply have to enter your size and price for each NFT market to get started.

After submitting the order, you will have to approve the transaction in the background tab of your wallet. Once approved, the order will be sent to the books and you will be able to see it under the **Open Orders** tab.

If the NFT/item for sale has a predetermined market price (ie. [Serum Ledger Nano X](https://solible.com/#/trade/327ubUZkUUAEdeWvyQYh1Ycs9mt6yDnt7jDAW47U3krw) at 50 SRM), bidding the best offer (50 SRM) will result in an automatic purchase - a market buy.

You will need to settle your balances after purchasing an NFT - same as you would for trading on the regular DEX. See our [Settlement article for more info](/orders/settle/).

You will need to settle the NFT from your balances for it to be in your wallet. See the token [settlement article](/orders/settle)

_Bidding under the market price or submitting an offer to a countdown auction would be considered as an open order. When countdown reaches 0, the highest bid will automatically receive the token; while unsuccessful bids will remain as open orders in the orderbook._
