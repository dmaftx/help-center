Solible a real-time NFT auction house that is powered by a fully on-chain orderbook. Users can put up bids and offers for NFTs as they would trading on a regular market.

In the above image, we can see that for the LSD NFT we currently have offers at 2500 SRM, and a bid at 120 SRM. You will be able to place orders on the book and it will appear under the "Open Orders" tab.
