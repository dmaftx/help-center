The beauty of Serum is that it has a fully on-chain orderbook, which means that unlike DEXes based on automated market makers (AMMs) you have the ability to place a resting order on a live on-chain orderbook, just as you would on a traditional centralized exchange like FTX. You can choose the price you want to buy or sell at.

Once youâ€™ve selected the price you want your order to be filled, that order will be sent out via a transaction and rest on the on-chain orderbook until the market hits your order.
