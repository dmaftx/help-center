## Network fee

Like all network fees, the cost varies depending on the underlying blockchain and the amount of load it’s under at the moment. With the [core technologies](https://medium.com/solana-labs/7-innovations-that-make-solana-the-first-web-scale-blockchain-ddc50b1defda) of Solana, the average network fees on the Serum DEX is approximately [\$0.00001 per transaction](https://solana.com/). This means the current [Bonfida Airdrop](https://bonfida.com) of 0.004 SOL (~0.00764) can theoretically cover 764 transactions!

Network fees are incurred when you perform the following actions:

1. Place an order (Limit or Market)
2. Cancel an order
3. Settle funds after a trade
4. Send/Deposit funds on Solana-based wallets

## Trading fee

Trading fees are incurred only when an order is executed:

| Fee tier | Taker | Maker  | Requirements  |
| -------- | ----- | ------ | ------------- |
| 0        | 0.22% | -0.03% | None          |
