After a trade is executed on Serum, the funds that result from the outcome of that trade does not automatically get credited to your connected wallet.

![balance-standalone](balance-standalone.png)

Let’s look at this picture to explain. Your **wallet balance** is what you currently have in the wallet, whereas the **unsettled balance** represents the funds from the trades you’ve executed on that market.

Example: In the SRM/USDT market. You place an order to buy 100 SRM with wrapped USDT. This 100 SRM will then appear in the **unsettled balance**.

How do you get the funds to your wallet then? You’ll have to click **Settle**, and execute a transaction that will send the funds to the wallet you’ve connected to Serum.
